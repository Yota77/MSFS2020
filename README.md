Disclaimer:
   -You can only have one single Livrery in community folder. If you want more than one, you have to merge it.

1. **How To install:**
   1. Windows Version: Copy your favorite Livery folder in %localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_$yourmagicnumber$\LocalCache\Packages\Community
   1. Steam: Go in steamappscommon or where you installed the game and inside Packages a folder called Community, then copy your favorite Livery folder.



2. **How to Merge Livreries:**
   1. Put all TEXTURE.$aircompany$ in the same folder, then modify layout.json and aircraft.cfg   
   2. for Aircraft.cfg just add a new [FLTSIM.X], where x is a counter/number then add your Livrery. (Remember FLTSIM.0 is the default one)
   3. for layout.json just add the path of the TEXTURE.$aircompany$
